A 6-DoF arm driven from fixed cameras, with no fiducial marker on the robot
itself. Arm pose is recovered from plain RGB by a keypoint model trained in
simulation and adapted to the physical bench.

*R6A* stands for **Robot à 6 Axes**. The work started on a five-axis arm — R5A —
and moved to a six-axis one; the name followed the hardware. Earlier material
still carrying the R5A label refers to this same project before that change.

---

## Problem

Robotic cells that adapt to a change of environment are heavy and expensive.
Reconfiguring an arm designed for one workcell to serve another means a full
re-integration — which puts the technology out of reach of the SMEs facing the
repetitive, low-added-value tasks it would serve best.

A specific technical lock sits underneath. In an **eye-to-hand** layout — cameras
fixed, robot moving inside their field — guiding the arm requires knowing the
camera-to-robot transform at all times. Classical approaches bolt physical
markers onto the arm: awkward to fit, awkward to keep aligned. Estimating that
pose directly from an RGB image, marker-free, requires a learned model, and
therefore:

- a volume of annotated training data that cannot realistically be produced by
  hand on the physical robot;
- a **sim-to-real domain gap** between rendered and captured images.

## Objective

Build a modular, affordable robotic system on open-source emerging technology,
able to adapt to its environment while holding a level of robustness and
precision compatible with industrial use. Lower development cost must not be
paid for in reliability — which is why measurement, not demonstration, gates
every claim in this repository.

## Approach: digital twin and test benches

Simulation and hardware are one closed loop here, not two parallel activities.

```

1. **Digital twin** — robot and cell modelled under Gazebo Harmonic and ROS 2,
   with scene randomisation (lighting, backgrounds, objects, joint poses).
   See `mycobot_description/worlds/randomized.sdf`, `randomized_v2.sdf`.
2. **Data generation at scale** — the simulation emits images *and* their
   annotations automatically, derived from forward kinematics. This is the step
   that cannot be reproduced by hand on hardware.
3. **Training, then adaptation** — pre-training on synthetic data, then mixed
   fine-tuning that folds in real frames captured on the bench, to close the
   sim-to-real gap.
4. **Validation on the instrumented bench** — the physical bench is the
   arbiter. It confronts the model with measurement and feeds corrections back
   into the twin.
5. **Metrological characterisation of the bench itself** — before measuring an
   algorithm, measure the instrument: repeatability, approach-direction effect,
   open-loop error, vision stability, extrinsic calibration accuracy, then
   end-to-end performance.

**Point 5 is load-bearing.** Without a metrological baseline, an improvement
cannot be attributed to the model rather than to the robot. The protocol,
standard by standard, is in
[`training/calibration/PROTOCOLE_ESSAIS_PRECISION.md`](training/calibration/PROTOCOLE_ESSAIS_PRECISION.md);
the method behind it in
[`training/calibration/METHODOLOGIE_PRECISION.md`](training/calibration/METHODOLOGIE_PRECISION.md) (FR).

The project runs on **two complementary benches, in Nanterre and in Lyon**,
which imposes a shared protocol across sites so that campaigns stay comparable.
The precision campaign data currently in this repository
(`training/calibration/*_2026-09-09.csv`) was acquired on the **Lyon** bench.

## Architecture

The system is split between a development workstation and the robot's embedded
board. Heavy computation (inference, calibration, training) stays on the
workstation; the board runs the motion bridge.

## Status

| State | Item |
|---|---|
| **Validated** | Modular ROS 2 architecture split across workstation and embedded board |
| **Validated** | MyCobot 320 Pi integrated; multi-camera cell with per-camera intrinsics; workspace referenced by four ArUco markers |
| **Validated** | End-to-end synthetic data generation under Gazebo, with scene randomisation |
| **Validated** | Marker-free pose estimation (DREAM architecture) trained, sim-to-real fine-tuned, evaluated on held-out real frames — see [`training/dream/README.md`](training/dream/README.md) |
| **Validated** | Real-time ROS 2 dashboard comparing inference against encoders |
| **Validated** | Vision-guided pick-and-place, validated in simulation then replayed closed-loop on the physical bench — see [`docs/PICK_AND_PLACE_BOUCLE_FERMEE.md`](docs/PICK_AND_PLACE_BOUCLE_FERMEE.md) (FR) |
| **Validated** | Structured metrology campaign, repeatability assessed against ISO 9283 |
| **Validated** | Hand teleoperation — Orbbec Astra → Wilor → rosbridge → joint trajectory → robot, validated on the physical arm on 2026-04-22 — see [`docs/TELEOPERATION.md`](docs/TELEOPERATION.md) (FR) |
| **In progress** | Teleoperation is currently **blocked on the system side**: a `fastcdr` ABI mismatch in the installed ROS 2 prevents rosbridge from starting |
| **In progress** | Extrinsic recalibration exists as a node and a script ([`scripts/calibration_extrinseque_auto.py`](scripts/calibration_extrinseque_auto.py)) with leave-one-out self-check, but is not yet wired as an automatic startup step in any launch file |
| **In progress** | Learned object detection: a YOLOv8 detector ([`scripts/yolo_object_detect.py`](scripts/yolo_object_detect.py)) is used by the live pick pipeline, but the ROS 2 node in the graph is still HSV-based |
| **In progress** | Physical-grasp sorting in simulation: outcome is **not deterministic** at identical commanded geometry — see [`docs/PICK_AND_PLACE_SIMULATION.md`](docs/PICK_AND_PLACE_SIMULATION.md) (FR) |
| **Validated** | Episode export to LeRobot v3.0 and to RLDS/TFDS, the Open X-Embodiment format, registered in OpenVLA's own configs, transforms and mixtures — and tested, not asserted. **Two scripted episodes: this proves the plumbing, it trains nothing** ([`Gazebo_to_LeRobot_Pipeline/`](Gazebo_to_LeRobot_Pipeline/), [`ROS2_to_RLDS_Conversion_OpenVLA/`](ROS2_to_RLDS_Conversion_OpenVLA/)) |
| **In progress** | Task-grounded pick-and-place in headless Gazebo: **20 episodes**, 2670 training frames and 927 from a camera mount never seen in training — a held-out *viewpoint*, not just held-out images ([`Headless_Task-Grounded_Pick-and-Place_in_Gazebo/`](Headless_Task-Grounded_Pick-and-Place_in_Gazebo/)) |
| **In progress** | That dataset's grasp is a **simulated attachment, not a physical grasp** — the grasp itself is unsolved there, and the sim runs at a 0.082 real-time factor |
| **To come** | An actual VLA fine-tune. It needs far more episodes on a real task than any of the above provides |
| **To come** | Replace HSV thresholding with a learned detector *inside the ROS 2 graph* |
| **To come** | Higher simulation realism for vision-guided pick-and-place |
| **To come** | Extended multi-view fusion and an additional keypoint, to lift the last-joint limitation |
| **To come** | Automation of the collect / replay / analysis chain |
| **To come** | Migration of the simulation path to NVIDIA Isaac Sim (parity to be proven on its own branch) |

### Open issues

These are stated rather than hidden; they shape what the results mean.

- **The last joint is structurally unobservable.** No keypoint in the 7-point
  schema depends on J6's own rotation; measured forward-kinematic displacement
  of all keypoints across its range is zero. Not a tuning problem — it needs a
  keypoint downstream of J6, or a second view.
- **Extrinsic calibration is validated only in the table plane.** All
  calibration markers are coplanar, so the fit carries no evidence off that
  plane.
- **Lighting and exposure sensitivity is not sufficiently characterised.**
- **No external metrological reference.** Every measurement to date depends on
  the robot's own encoders or on the vision chain, which cannot arbitrate
  between them. A calibrated external artefact is the missing instrument.

## Installation

**Workstation** — Ubuntu 24.04, ROS 2 Jazzy, Python 3.12, Gazebo Harmonic.
An NVIDIA GPU is required for training, not for running the cell.

```bash
sudo apt install ros-jazzy-ros-gz-sim ros-jazzy-ros-gz-bridge \
                 ros-jazzy-ros2-control ros-jazzy-ros2-controllers \
                 ros-jazzy-gz-ros2-control
```

Gazebo **Harmonic**, not Gazebo Classic — the package names differ and Classic
tutorials do not transpose.

```bash
# Conda's interpreter shadows the one ROS 2 needs. Leave it first, in every
# terminal, or imports fail with opaque C-extension errors.
conda deactivate

cd <your_ws>/src
git clone https://github.com/ABMI-software/mycobot_320pi_R6A.git
cd mycobot_320pi_R6A

# Git LFS carries the DREAM training images only (datasets/**/*.png).
# Not needed for simulation, pick-and-place or robot control.
git lfs pull

cd <your_ws>
colcon build --packages-select mycobot_gateway mycobot_description --symlink-install
source install/setup.bash
```

`colcon build` runs from the workspace root, never from `src/` — colcon writes
`build/`, `install/` and `log/` into its working directory.

Python dependencies for training are in
[`training/requirements.txt`](training/requirements.txt) and belong in a
dedicated environment, never in the ROS 2 interpreter.

### Verify the installation

```bash
ros2 launch mycobot_gateway real_table.launch.py
```

Gazebo must open on the wooden table with its four ArUco markers and the arm.
A **grey table with no markers** means `models/` was not installed: run
`colcon build` again.

## Quick start

All commands assume `conda deactivate` and a sourced workspace.

```bash
# Simulated cell, wooden table replicating the physical bench
ros2 launch mycobot_gateway real_table.launch.py

# Physical-grasp sorting bench — two terminals
ros2 launch mycobot_gateway sim_grasp.launch.py       # headless:=true to skip the window
ros2 run mycobot_gateway sim_sorting_grasp --ros-args -p use_sim_time:=true

# Marker-free pose estimation, live against the encoders
ros2 launch mycobot_gateway dream_multicam.launch.py  # auto-detects 1 or 2 cameras

# Synthetic dataset collection
ros2 launch mycobot_gateway synthetic_data_v3.launch.py

# Precision benchmark — 9-target grid, CSV report
ros2 launch mycobot_gateway precision_benchmark.launch.py

# Hand teleoperation (simulation target; four terminals in all)
ros2 launch mycobot_gateway mycobot_teleop.launch.py target:=sim

# Before any physical session
bash scripts/real_robot_preflight.sh
```

Teleoperation needs its own conda environment and three further terminals —
the full sequence is in [`docs/TELEOPERATION.md`](docs/TELEOPERATION.md) (FR).

The robot's board address is **not fixed**. Confirm it with a TCP round-trip on
port 5005 before running anything that commands motion — a successful `ping`
proves nothing.

## Experimental results

Numbers are not reproduced here — they belong with their protocol, and are
worthless detached from it.

| Version history | [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md) (FR) |

Two cautions when reading any of it. An extrinsic's fit residual is **not** an
accuracy — leave-one-out on a held-out marker is the honest figure. And a
repeatability figure is not an absolute accuracy: they answer different
questions and are routinely confused.

## Roadmap

1. Learned object detection inside the ROS 2 graph, replacing HSV thresholding.
2. Higher simulation realism for vision-guided pick-and-place, and a contact
   model that makes the sorting bench reproducible.
3. Extended multi-view fusion plus an additional keypoint downstream of the last
   joint, to lift the observability limit.
4. Automated collection, replay and analysis of test campaigns, so that
   cross-site campaigns stay comparable.
5. External metrological reference, independent of encoders and vision.
6. Marker-free pose estimation on the pick path itself — today the pick uses
   the ArUco extrinsic, and only the dashboard consumes the model. The
   comparison protocol is specified in
   [`docs/SPEC_VALIDATION_BRIQUES.md`](docs/SPEC_VALIDATION_BRIQUES.md) (FR).
7. Migration of the simulation path to NVIDIA Isaac Sim, on its own branch until
   parity with the current twin is demonstrated.

## Contributing

Read [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md) before the first commit. In short:

- Three Python environments coexist and must not be mixed — `conda deactivate`
  before any ROS 2 command, every time.
- Branch per domain; commit scope matches branch.
- Conventional prefixes (`feat` · `fix` · `docs` · `refactor` · `test` · `chore`
  · `perf`), scoped, with the *why* and its measured numbers in the body.
- Any user-visible change updates [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md) (FR) in the
  same commit.
- Anything touching the physical robot requires a preflight and a documented
  physical test pass.
- State the protocol with a number, or do not state the number.

`.claude/` restates these rules for tooling; `CONTRIBUTING.md` is the source of
truth.
